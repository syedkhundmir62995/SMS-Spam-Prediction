# SMS-Spam-Prediction
### Project Details:
- Mobile phones industry is one of the largest industries having exponentially increasing number of users every day is a vast field for fraudulent activity. The most widespread cases of fraud in the Mobile phones area are fraud messages, fake profiles, fraud calls and cloning. Fraud has a direct influence on the relationship established between the company and the subscriber. The SMS data was downloaded from UCI directory. It contains 5,574 SMS phone messages. The data were collected for the purpose of mobile phone spam research and have already been labeled as either spam or ham.

### Opportunity:
- One of the most common and easiest forms of online frauds is SMS spams which may include Credit card reward, Lottery, Matrimonial and Online payment frauds where the users are sent with text messages requesting anything from account passwords right through to bank account and other personal details.

### Approach:
- The Idea behind this project is to identify whether a SMS is Spam or not. I have used the text messages from UCI datasets and fit machine learning & deep learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Artificial Neural Network and compared the accuracy and loss on validation set across these two models. Finally, I selected the Artificial Neural Network model to classify text messages as spam or ham and used it to classify new text messages. I took this initiative to categorize messages by identifying whether they are spam or not. Two different models were used for SMS Spam classification of which one with the best accuracy was selected.

### Results:
- I used the accuracy score as our measurement metric and achieved an accuracy of 95%+ on the test as well as validation data. This solution coupled with heuristics on follow-up actions and was deployed as a daily batch run to assign specific offerings to target customers.
